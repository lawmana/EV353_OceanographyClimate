    "# EV353 Problem Set 1 - The Ocean Mixed Layer Heat and Salt Budgets \n",
    "## Part 2: Python Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixed layer is the uppermost layer of the surface ocean where temperature and salinity are approximately constant with depth. All exchanges of mass and energy between the ocean and the atmosphere pass through the mixed layer, making it a crucial component of climate variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set, you will demonstrate both your *qualitative and quantitative* understanding of the surface ocean’s heat and salinity budgets. Your responses should incorporate the concepts covered in class and the assigned readings. Chapters 1-3 in Physical Oceanography and Climate by Kris Karnauskas and this week’s scientific papers will be helpful references. \n",
    "\n",
    "**To foster a collaborative learning environment, you will complete this lab with a partner.** The pairings will be randomly determined in class and posted on Canvas. Each person is required to complete and contribute to all questions. This includes performing all calculations/analyses and writing your own code. *It is against the honor code to divide up the questions among different individuals or use generative AI/chatbots on any aspect this assignment. All answers must be written in your own words.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the physical processes that control the temperature and salinity of seawater both mathematically and in plain language.\n",
    "- Apply the heat and salinity budget equations to real-world observations.\n",
    "- Articulate the significance of energy and mass fluxes through the ocean-atmosphere interface in the context of the broader global climate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1** includes written responses and hand calculations. To receive full credit, you must show your work and explain your reasoning. **Part 2** includes data analysis exercises in Python. You will use this Jupyter Notebooks to manipulate and visualize geospatial datasets, perform calculations, and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Data Sets \n",
    "To complete this lab, you will need the following data sets (posted on Canvas):\n",
    "1. ``oiv2.nc`` NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2 (OISST v2) \n",
    "2. ``tao.nc`` NOAA Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) Array\n",
    "3. ``aquarius.nc`` Aquarius Sea Surface Salinity\n",
    "4. ``gpcp.nc`` Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "Generating high-quality figures is an important part of science comunication! All figures (time series & maps) must be properly formatted to receive full credit. This means including titles, axes labels (with units), and legends, as appropriate. The aspect ratio should be appropriate for the type of figure (i.e., the figures are not compressed or stretched). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please use the Python packages [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) and [cmocean colormaps for oceanography](https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/) when generating maps. Take care to use intuitive colormaps and colorbar levels for the type of data you are representing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The grading rubric for part 2 is provided at the end of the companion Word Document for this assignment."

    "Using the NOAA OISSTv2 product (1° latitude x 1° longitude global grid) and the TAO array, describe how the equatorial thermocline varies as a function of longitude. How does the equatorial thermocline relate to the variation of SST along the equator? Based on the relationship you identified between SST and the depth of the thermocline, where would you expect more productive marine ecosystems and why? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the questions above, use Python to generate a global map of average SST from 1982 until the end of the record. Then generate a depth vs. longitude temperature cross section along the equator using the TAO data array. Annotate your vertical cross section in code or by hand to indicate the approximate bounds of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. Paste your final figures in your main problem set document.\n",

    "2. Define a variable called `sst` that is the sst DataArray within the oiv2 DataSet   \n",

    "4. Generate a Pacific-centered map of average SST using cartopy, matplotlib, and the cmocean thermal colormap. The Robinson projection centered on 180° longitude on the Pacific is recommended. Add a colorbar and label it with the appropriate units. Some example code is provided below to help get you started. *Hint: use `sst.plot.contourf()`*\n",

The land values are filled by a Cressman interpolation to produce a complete grid for possible interpolation to other grids (see documentation [here](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html)). Given that there is no analysis over land, fill in the land to highlight only the SST data (e.g., with a lightgray color).\n",

    "9. Plot a depth vs. longitude temperature cross section along the equator. Use the same cmocean thermal colormap and levels as the SST map to facilitate comparison. Invert the y-axis so that the surface (0 m) is at the top of the figure. Add a title and label all axes. Save the figure as `tao_mean_temp_cross_section.png`\n",

    "The ocean MLD, *h* is a key variable in many fundamental equations and budgets in physical oceanography. For this activity, you will work with the IFREMER Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) Climatology. The dataset is a globally gridded climatology of MLD informed by hydrographic profiles taken from ships, floats, etc. The dataset has 2° spatial resolution and includes monthly averages from 1941-2002.\n",
